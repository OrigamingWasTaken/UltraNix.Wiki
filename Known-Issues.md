## All Platforms
* All limitations of GLCore are present, such as disabled silhouettes. [\*](https://github.com/coatlessali/GLCoreScissors)
* Pressing/Releasing any mouse button will cause your POV to rotate *one singular unit* in whichever direction it moved last.

## Linux
* Scrolling in menus is very slow/inverted.
* Multiple in-game videos do not play, as the Linux UnityPlayer does not support mp4 files. [\*](https://github.com/coatlessali/UltraNixVideoFix)
* Game may randomly abort during startup.
* Usage of gamescope and alt-tabbing may cause input problems.

## MacOS
* Despite MP4 files being supported, none of the in-game movies play and show as completely transparent. [\*](https://github.com/coatlessali/UltraNixVideoFix)
* Using mouse tweaking software such as [Mos](https://mos.caldis.me/) can cause scrolling issues, especially if smooth scrolling is turned on.
* The game will crash if certain folders aren't present in `ULTRAKILL.app`, such as `Preferences`, `CyberGrind`, and `Saves`.
