#### Is this a recompilation of ULTRAKILL?
No. This is a script that downloads a dummy UnityPlayer, and moves the game files into their proper place to be run on UNIX-likes.

#### Is this supported?
Not officially. Please don't report any bugs occurring with these ports to any official sources, unless you can reproduce them on the Windows build. I will provide as much support as I can, but don't be surprised if the devs add a Windows-only library, or remove OpenGLCore, and the game stops working permanently. Feel free to open issues in the GitHub repository, or hit me (coatlessali) up in the ULTRAKILL or Newblood Discord servers.

#### What if the ULTRAKILL team members take issue with this project?
At their request, **I will take down this repository/all associated plugins, no questions asked.**

#### I can use Proton instead, should I?
Yes. These ports are to be treated as a curiosity, and only for those who do not meet the system requirements for Proton, or take issue with it.

#### Where do I get ULTRAKILL?
You can purchase it via Steam in a web browser, and download it using the methods documented [here](https://github.com/coatlessali/UltraNix/wiki/Downloading-ULTRAKILL-and-Plugins).

**Support will not be provided for pirate copies, you are on your own.**

#### Are mods supported?
Short answer? Sort of. Mod support page coming soon.
